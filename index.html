<h1>Faisan Friends</h1>
<h3>Our RAs</h3>
<body> Faisan has the BEST RA's Stanford can find! From the dark horse Christina to the noble leader Eliza and every seaweed-eating Noah in between, you're not going to find a group of RA's like any other.</body> 
  <h3>Our "basically other RAs"</h3>
  <body> Not only does Faisan have the most amazing group of RAs, but we also have two other equally amazing people who I like to dub the "basically other RAs." This is because they do many of the same things our RAs do, and play an equally important role in the residents' lives. These two people are fun-loving Caroline and Pun-loving Miguel--our RCC and SLERT! You won't find a group of people smiling more :)</body>
    <h3>Our Residents</h3>
    <body> The residents of Faisan include a wide range of people coming from all sorts of diverse backgrounds. Just to name a few, we have a resident poet, dinosaur, and spirit guide.. This is not to mention the many other slerds (that is, SLE nerds) that live amongst the chaos. Moreover, Faisan enjoys sharing the flove with its two upperclassmen ambassadors (or, the only upperclassmen that attend house meetings, speak to frosh, or say hi to anyone ever as I like to call them)--Daniel and Amy!
